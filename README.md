# PDGSBP
Density estimation for partially exchangeable observations using Geometric Stick Breaking processes. The implementation avoids vectorization leading to faster execution times in Julia. 

The algorithm works with Julia 0.6.4. There are few adjustments to be made in order to work with the current version 1.0.
